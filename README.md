# Crop_prediction_KNN_algorithm
Our Crop Prediction Algorithm utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm and a dataset containing conditions favorable for crops. By inputting specific environmental data, users receive personalized crop recommendations. 
While our algorithm is built on extensive data and has a high accuracy of 98%, it is essential to understand that agricultural outcomes can be influenced by various factors, and results may vary.
